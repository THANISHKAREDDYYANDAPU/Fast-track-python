1)What makes numpy.shape()different from numpy.size()?
a)shape() is used to get complete structural shape of our 2d array
For example:_np.size()will gives us how many elements are present in total.

2)In Numpy,describe the idea of broad casting?	
a)The term broad casting refers to the ability of Numpy to treat arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations.Arithmetic operations on arrays are usually done on corresponding elements.If two arrays are of exactly the same shape ,then these operations are smoothly performed.
3)What makes python better than other libraries for numerical computation?
a)One of the key features of python is its numerous libraries and packages.In this article,we will list down the popular packages and libraries in python.
1)The scipy package includes algorithms and functions which are the crux of python scientific computing capabilities.
Io:used for the standard input and out put
Lib:this function is used to wrap python external libraries
Signal:used for processing signal tools
Linals:used for the regular linear algebra applications
2) Pandas:
Pandas is the most important data analysis library of python.Being open source,it is used for analysing data with pythin.It can take data formats of CSVor TSV files,or a SQL data base and convert it into python data frames with rows and columns which is similar to tables in stastical formats.
3)Ipython:
It is a browser-based note book interface which supports code,text,mathematical expressioons,inline plots and various media for interfactive data visualisations.


4)How does numpy deal with files?
a) NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed.
NumPy is a Python package. It stands for ‘Numerical Python’. It is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing of array.
Numeric, the ancestor of NumPy, was developed by Jim Hugunin. Another package Numarray was also developed, having some additional functionalities. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy package by incorporating the features of Numarray into Numeric package. There are many contributors to this open-source project.
5)Mention the importance of Numpy.empty()?
a)The numpy module of python provides a function called numpy.empty().This function is used to create an array with out initializing the entries of givenshape and type.The numpy.empty() function doesn’t set the array values to zero, and it is quite faster than the numpy.zeroes ().This function requires the user to set all the values in the arary manually and should be used with caution.
Parametre:-This parameter defines the shape of the empty order:{‘c’,’f’}
Dtype:this parameter defines the data type ,which is desired for the output array.
Order:this parameter defines the order in which the multi dimensional array is going to be stored either in row-major or column-major.
